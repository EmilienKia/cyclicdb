cyclicdb examples
=================

These examples are code snippets demonstrating cyclicdb API usage.

As a whole, they are not vetted carefully for bugs, error
handling, and cross-platform compatibility in the same manner as the rest
of the code in cyclicdb, so copy with caution.

That being said, you are welcome to copy code from these examples as
desired when using cyclicdb. They have been [released to the public domain][cc0],
so there are no restrictions on their use.
