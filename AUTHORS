# The CyclicDB AUTHORS file.  Don't be shy.  If you have contributed to this
# project in some way, send me a patch to add yourself to this file.
#
# Everyone deserves credit, including those who haven't added any code.
# Ideas, clues, and helping out on the mailing lists all count too.
#
# This is a blatant ripoff of the fields found in the Linux kernel's CREDITS
# file.  If we need more data, those fields can always be added later.
#
# N = name, E = email, W = web address, D = description, P = PGP info,
# S = snailmail address, etc.
#
# This file is supposed to be roughly alpha-sorted by the last name, but
# if you want to hide at the bottom, that's fine by me.  Just clarify
# your preference when submitting changes to this file.
